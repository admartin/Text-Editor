##Reflection

This project did'nt turn out the way I had hoped. There was just way too much to
implement and too little time to write it. I felt like I would have done better if there was more structure (like a skeleton code) to base this project off of.
I understand wanting the students to do outside learning but I wish we would 
have had a basic overview of ncurses in class. I consider myslef a decent
programmer and I really struggled with this project. I've never turned in 
any assignment with this many bugs, let alone a project. An assignment of this 
size would have been better served as a group project and I can only hope the
remaining projects in this class aren't like this.
